**Summary**

The objective of this assignment is to simulate the movement of students within a classroom setting: whether it be sitting, standing in line, or in a more complex fashion, playing the game of Musical Chairs. For a more indepth overview: Musical chairs is a classic party game that involves a group of participants moving around a circle of chairs as music plays in the background. At irregular intervals, the music stops, and the players must scramble to find a vacant chair to occupy. With each round, one chair is removed, and the number of players remaining will eventually exceed the number of chairs available. The players left standing are eliminated, and the game continues until there is only one player remaining. This popular game is often used as a metaphor for the competitive and unpredictable nature of life, as it highlights the need to be quick, strategic, and adaptable in the face of uncertainty.

**Skills Utilized**

The RU project required the utilization of highly advanced skills, including the employment of intricate linked lists and circular linked lists, complex two-dimensional arrays, and other complex data structures. These skills were indispensable in the creation of a highly theoretical simulation of students' movement in a classroom setting, using the popular game of Musical Chairs as the primary framework. To achieve this, the project demanded a deep understanding of the manipulation and traversal of node data, as well as the application of probability theory, all while being able to handle large volumes of data with ease. In essence, this project was a formidable challenge that demanded an extraordinary level of technical proficiency and problem-solving acumen.

**How to play?**

Simply, the user will be using the Driver, run with a input file of their choice in which the format follows that of a json, "name, last name, height, etc.". Afterwards, the user will be able to run each of the methods in Classroom individually, or more importantly, select option 8 after 1, 2, 3, 4, to run the actual musical chairs game. Note that the user will have to use logic: students must be in the musical chairs line if they are then going to be playing musical chairs.

**Miscellanous**

The user must have the following libraries installed: *StdRandom.java* *StdIn.java* *StdOut.java*

Also, please note that the game is played within the terminal, as it is an ASCII, text-based implementation.
